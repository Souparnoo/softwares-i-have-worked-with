# **üõ†Ô∏è Softwares I Have Worked With**

This repository is a collection of small, hands-on projects created using various engineering and simulation tools, including **LabVIEW**, **Proteus**, **MATLAB**, and others.  
Each folder represents a specific software platform and contains one or more mini-projects that demonstrate my practical exposure and learning.

These projects are not large-scale applications but focused exercises aimed at understanding key features, interfaces, and functionalities of each tool.  
They reflect my initiative to explore a variety of technical environments and strengthen my foundation in both hardware and software-based design tools.

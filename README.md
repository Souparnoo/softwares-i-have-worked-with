This repository is a collection of small, hands-on projects created using various engineering and simulation tools, including LabVIEW, Proteus, MATLAB, and others. Each folder represents a specific software platform and contains one or more mini-projects that demonstrate my practical exposure and learning.

These projects are not large-scale applications but are focused exercises aimed at understanding key features, interfaces, and functionalities of each tool. They reflect my initiative to explore a variety of technical environments and strengthen my foundation in both hardware and software-based design tools.

üìÅ Structure

‚úÖ Purpose
The goal of this repository is to document and showcase:

My early-stage explorations in popular engineering tools

A growing familiarity with software used in control systems, embedded electronics, and simulations

My ability to self-learn and apply concepts outside of formal coursework

üìå Note
These projects are simplified and experimental in nature, designed primarily for learning and practice. I plan to expand this repository as I gain experience with more advanced tools and workflows.
